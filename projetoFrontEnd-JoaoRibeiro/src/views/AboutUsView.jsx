							<h3>Hello, my name is João Pedro! </h3>
							<img src='/img/joao.png' alt='João Pedro' />
						</div>
						<p>
							The adventurous spirit and the passion for nature adventure were always present in my life. From my childhood to University, I participate in different adventure activities. I begin in
							the field of sports playing football and I would switch this for some hiking in the nature or to practice Kayak in water lines. I finished my academic life and challenged myself to leave
							Portugal to work in a cruise ship and that allowed me to travel all over the world and experience new experiences and improve my skills. I was flow rider monitor (surf simulator) and did
							the training to be indoor skydiving instructor (indoor skydiving tunnel). Back to Portugal, I followed my passion and created Inside Experiences (together with Liliana Pereira) with
							various activities for which I have been trained and have always maintained contact and passion over the years. Adventure yourselves and come to explore our experiences! Feel invited!
